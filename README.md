<h2>About this project<br></h2>
The aim of this project is to write codes for plotting modulated and demodulated signals in the time domain using an envelope detector circuit for a normal amplitude waveform. In addition, 
to evaluate the optimum value of the time constant that minimizes the mean square error between the modulated signal s(t) and the output signal of the envelope detector using 
Matlab Software.
